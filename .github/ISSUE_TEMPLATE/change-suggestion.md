#### Specify the nature of the change
Describe the section that requires changing, e.g. ghost / gameplay / evidence items / non-evidence items / cursed items / hunts

#### Clearly state the suggested changes

Ideally copy the line(s) that require changes, and specify the recommended change underneath each line, to make each edit clear.

#### Provide citations where applicable
Avoid requesting changes based on "this happened to me once" - ensure that this issue is known in the community and ideally acknowledged by the developers or respected content creators.
