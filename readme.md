# Phasmophobia Ghost Finder

A tool to be used alongside the game Phasmophobia, to help with identifying the ghost, as well as calculating photograph value, randomising items for challenges, and maps to help you find your way.

## Screen flexibility

The ghost finder has been designed to automatically resize itself to fit many different screen sizes, from 1920x1080 to the smallest mobile screen.

## Maps

All current maps are avalilable directly above the clue selection, which show camera, circuit breaker, ouija board and other item locations. These were all created by third parties and all credits within the images have been maintained.

## Clue selection

Below the maps, the available evidence items are shown, with tick and cross choices to either include or disregard each one, to help narrow down the current ghost.

When an evidence item is included or disregarded, other evidence items that do not match any remaining ghost types will be disabled, to simplify the evidence-gathering process.

## Timers

Various timers have been configured to assist with making sure you're not caught out by an expiring smudge stick, non-professional hunt latency, etc. Simply select the timer you wish to use and hit the green button to start the timer.

The timers for the various hunt durations include the grace period at the start of the hunt, where the ghost appears but is not yet lethal.

The timer will tick three times at 30s remaining, twice at 20s, once at 10s, and once for the final 5 seconds, after which an alarm will sound and the timer panel will flash. Selecting the Mute option will prevent these sounds from playing.

Due to the mechanics behind the timer, if it is paused before reaching zero, pressing Play again will resume from the current point, and upon hitting zero, will reset to that paused time. Selecting a new timer option will reset this to default.

## Photo calculator

Pulling out the Photos tab will bring up the photo value calculator, which allows you to see how much money you'll earn from the photos you've taken.

Do note that only one Ghost photo counts towards your rewards in-game, regardless of the ability to select multiple in the calculator.

## Roll randomisers

Pulling out the Roll tab will bring up the map and item randomiser, which allows you to select any number of random items.

Clicking an item will surround it with a solid border, and using a "Roll" button will choose a random selected item. Additional items may be selected without clearing the existing chosen items.

## Keyboard shortcuts

The tool includes built-in support for keyboard shortcuts to make it easier to switch out, hit a key and return to the game.
